## Introduction

The **Visual Inference Lab** is based at the **Mortimer B. Zuckerman Mind Brain Behavior Institute** at Columbia University in the City of New York. We are a research group dedicated to exploring computation mechanisms of vision in both biological and artificial systems.

## Objective

Our lab studies the brain information processing that enables visual perception, object recognition, and scene understanding, aiming to bridge the gap between **Computational Neuroscience**, **Cognitive Science**, and **Artificial Intelligence**.

## Principal Investigator
